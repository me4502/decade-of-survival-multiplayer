## 2013 - Rise of the Network

### Spigot

On the [15th of January 2013](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper/commit/622229778428e822be7c97d9c5f08ddb6281d97f), md_5 rebranded the CraftBukkit-- project to Spigot. The Spigot project, while still partnered with EcoCityCraft, was no longer a project owned and developed by EcoCityCraft but its own separate thing. As Spigot started cementing themselves as a real Bukkit alternative, the community began to split between the Bukkit and Spigot forums. Spigot also added a resources subsection to their forums, to allow Spigot-only plugins to be released due to new BukkitDev rules against plugins that couldn’t run on CraftBukkit. Since launch, Spigot has remained a major player in the server software space.

### Super Networks

Mineplex was a server network that launched on the [24th of January 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineplex). It was the first “super-network,” hitting a record of over 34 thousand simultaneous players with an average of over 10 thousand concurrent players. Gaining initial popularity from videos made by CaptainSparklez, the server went on to set a Guinness World Record for their player count. Mineplex’s popularity started to dwindle later and has now become a predominantly Minecraft Bedrock Edition server network due to a partnership with Mojang.

On the 13th of April 2013, the Hypixel server network launched. Hypixel grew beyond the size of Mineplex, and is the definite champion of Minecraft server networks, averaging over 100 thousand concurrent players. Unlike Mineplex, however, Hypixel is only available on Minecraft Java Edition. Hypixel has 4 Guinness World Records, including the one for player count that was previously held by Mineplex.

### Proxy Developments

Keeping permissions synchronised across multiple servers in a network started to become a more significant problem due to the growing size and scope of networks, leading to the development of a plugin known as BungeePerms on the [3rd of April 2013](https://github.com/weaondara/BungeePerms/commit/c37ffe2ca7044e58f76e07bc754ca75df9aa8aaa) by weaondara. BungeePerms allowed multiple servers on a network to share permission setups, a feature which has since been adopted into other plugins such as LuckPerms.

On the 20th of April 2013, Coelho started the LilyPad project, providing an alternate proxy to BungeeCord. LilyPad aimed to provide a more straightforward plugin API while using significantly fewer resources than BungeeCord, and was eventually also ported to the Go language to further improve performance.

Led by a server network known as The Chunk, the RedisBungee project started on the [29th of September 2013](https://github.com/minecrafter/RedisBungee/commit/d0f5a24f38ff5251dacb981a96de54ab68d0af38). RedisBungee was the first public project that allowed combining multiple Minecraft proxies, due to scaling issues that larger networks were starting to face. Like Minecraft servers, proxies also have limitations in the number of players they support. Due to this, scaling the number of proxies in use became a common practice on larger networks.
