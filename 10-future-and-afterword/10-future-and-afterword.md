## The future, and afterword

Predicting the future is hard, but it can always be fun and interesting to give it a go. I feel that the Paper project, which is already gaining a majority user base, will soon become the de facto Bukkit implementation and therefore have control over API additions. Once this happens, I feel that there will be a strong push to modernise the API, which wouldn’t happen otherwise within Spigot.

I feel that Minecraft Bedrock Edition and Java Edition will continue to gain feature parity, with a potential protocol merge, allowing players to play on the servers of either platform natively. Bedrock Edition is growing much faster than Java Edition, so if this does not happen Java Edition servers will struggle to keep a player base.

Overall, I feel that Minecraft will live for another decade with a new generation of players. I just hope Minecraft Java Edition stays along for the ride.

### Contributors

I'd like to massively thank every single person who helped me with this document. This project was a community effort, and I couldn’t have finished it without you all. Here is a list of key contributors other than myself who have worked on this project:

_kashike, KennyTV, zml, Inscrutable, mdcfe, Aurora, Tux, Garanthor, Myokan, Glare, stifflered, mbaxter, DemonWav, LlmDl_

Special thanks to kashike for letting me co-opt a channel in the Kyori discord while writing this.

The Minecraft server community has been a large part of my life for the past decade, and this was part of my way of giving back. Throughout this project, I learnt so much more about the various people I’ve known and who have made the community what it is today, and I’ve gone on a very long nostalgia trip. I hope this article helps share their contributions with the Minecraft community of the future and give a new generation of players more perspective and context on what came before.
