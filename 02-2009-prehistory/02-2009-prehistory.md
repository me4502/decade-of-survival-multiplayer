# 2009 - Prehistory

## Minecraft Classic

Minecraft wouldn’t be where it is today without the version that came beforehand. Minecraft Classic, which was known at the time as Minecraft Alpha, underwent a series of releases referred to as [multiplayer tests](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_Multiplayer_Test). The first of these multiplayer tests that included standalone multiplayer server software was released all the way back in 2009, on the [7th of June](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_Classic_0.0.16a). Minecraft was very different at this time, being a small in-browser game with a small following. Two of Minecraft’s most well-known features, crafting and survival mode, were absent at this time with gameplay vaguely like a heavily simplified modern creative mode.

## NerdNu

Out of everything that happened during the Minecraft Classic era, one notable server launched that is still online to this day. [NerdNu](https://nerd.nu/) originally launched as the Minecraft subreddit’s public Minecraft server with `c.nerd.nu`, and later `s.nerd.nu`. This server first launched on the 10th of June 2009. Therefore, this is the oldest Minecraft server to be still running.

## WikiVG and #mcdevs

With a growing interest in Minecraft server modding, a few community members started a project to document the technical aspects of the game. Thus, [wiki.vg](https://wiki.vg) and the #mcdevs IRC channel were born. Initially launched at an [unknown time in 2009](https://paste.gg/p/zml/d029ee160daf45a78898319a8bfad5f2) at the URL `wiki.tkte.ch`, with an effort to document the game’s protocol started shortly after. The wiki migrated to the domain where it then resided on the [24th of October 2010](https://wiki.vg/index.php?title=Main_Page&offset=&limit=500&action=history). The IRC channel also underwent a migration to [Freenode](https://freenode.net/) at a similar time. To this day, the WikiVG project is the go-to place for technical information about Minecraft.
